# PaintApplication
Worked in team to build a "Drawing application" based on template provided; the following program scripted using JavaScript (jQuery and P5.js libraries). The application has minor bugs which need fixing and can be further developed with Node.js for multi-user drawing feature. HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and style; Node.js used for draw-sharing feature.
